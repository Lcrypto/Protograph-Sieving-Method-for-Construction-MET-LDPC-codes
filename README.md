# Protograph-Sieving-Method-for-Construction-MET-LDPC-codes
The GitHub repository contains a tool for searching Multi-edge Low-Density Parity-Check (MET-LDPC) code protographs (base matrices) using Protograph EXIT-chart with polynomial approximation. The tool provides an upper bound on the code distance estimation, which can be found in the "d_min compare.txt" file in the repository.

To estimate the code distance, the tool uses a separate tool from another repository at https://github.com/Lcrypto/Upper-Bound-on-Code-distance-from-Lifted-QC-parity-check-matrix, which provides an upper bound on the code distance from lifted Quasi-Cyclic parity-check matrices.

With this tool, you can search for MET-LDPC code protographs and estimate their code distance using the provided upper bound. This information can be useful for designing codes with specific properties or for analyzing the performance of existing codes.
